# What is Delm?

Delm is a Shopify application that allows you to add estimated delivery dates like **"Want it tomorrow? Order within 3 hrs and 42 min"** to your product pages.

## Why you should add estimated delivery dates

We believe that estimated delivery dates are an essential element of every e-commerce store that sells physical products. Visitors are interested about the delivery date before placing an order! Delm helps you to fill the informational gap that gets created, when you are not adding estimated delivery dates to your store.
