# What is Delm?

**Delm is a Shopify application** that allows you to add **estimated delivery dates** like "Want it tomorrow? Order within 3 hrs and 42 min" to your **product pages**.

## Why you should work with estimated delivery dates

We believe that estimated delivery dates are an essential element of every e-commerce store that sells physical products. Visitors are interested about the delivery date before placing an order. 

### Better user experience

Delm helps you to fill the informational gap that gets created, when you are not adding estimated delivery dates to your store. Your visitor won't have to leave your product page to read your more about your shipping conditions. This makes your overall experience more convenient.

### More trust, higher conversion rate

Convert more visitors into customers by solving an important mental barrier in their minds: "When will my order arrive?". The cut-off countdown helps you to create urgency without being too pushy.


### Reduce number of support requests

Fewer customers will ask you questions about the delivery time, as they can already see this information on your product page.
