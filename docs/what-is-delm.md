# What is Delm?

**Delm is a Shopify application** that allows you to add **estimated delivery dates** like "Want it tomorrow? Order within 3 hrs and 42 min" to your **product pages**.

## Why you should show estimated delivery dates

We strongly believe that estimated delivery dates are an essential element of every e-commerce store that sells physical products. Visitors are interested about the delivery date before placing an order.

### Increase conversion rate ([more](https://web.archive.org/web/20190418222132/https://baymard.com/blog/shipping-speed-vs-delivery-date))

Convert more visitors into customers by solving a seemingly simple question: "When will my order arrive?"

### Improve user experience

Don't make your visitors leave your product pages. Design your product pages as convenient as possible.

### Reduce support requests

Invest your precious time in other things because fewer customers will ask you delivery related questions.
