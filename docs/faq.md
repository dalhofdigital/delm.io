# Frequently asked questions

## How are the estimated delivery dates calculated?

`NEXT DISPATCH DATE` = Date of the current or next working day before the end of your cut-off time.

We make sure that the calculated dispatch date will always fall on a working day.

`ESTIMATED DELIVERY DATE` = `NEXT DISPATCH DATE` + `DELIVERY TIME`

We make sure that the calculated estimated delivery dates will never fall on a holiday or a non-deliverable day.
