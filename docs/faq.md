# Frequently asked questions

## Can I add the shipping info to my collection pages and cart page?

No, we only support product pages at this time but we'll make it possible to show the shipping info on collection pages and cart page in the future.

## Does this app connects with shipping service providers like UPS?

No.

## How are the estimated delivery dates calculated?

`NEXT DISPATCH DATE` = Date of the current or next working day before the end of your cut-off time.

We make sure that the calculated dispatch date will always fall on a working day.

`ESTIMATED DELIVERY DATE` = `NEXT DISPATCH DATE` + `DELIVERY TIME`

We make sure that the calculated estimated delivery dates will never fall on a holiday or a non-deliverable day.
